# Reading List

During my PhD, I have come across a number of papers that I think someone should
read in order to better understand the concept of subjunctive interfaces. 
I believe the concept is ripe for application in today's software and will have
big part to play in the next generations of creativity software.

A subjunctive interface is defined as follows:
> Subjunctive interfaces support the setting up, viewing and adjustment of 
> multiple scenarios in parallel, leading to more efficient iteration through 
> related scenarios, and the opportunity for side-by-side instead of 
> temporally separated viewing.

## Aran Lunzer

Aran created the concept of a _subjunctive interface_. He defines the concept
in his 1998 and 1999 papers.

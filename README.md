# Reading List

During my PhD, I have come across a number of papers that I think someone should
read in order to better understand the concept of subjunctive interfaces.

## Aran Lunzer

Aran created the concept of a _subjunctive interface_. He introduces the concept
in his 1998 and 1999 papers.

* Lunzer, A. Towards the subjunctive interface: General support for parameter exploration by overlaying alternative application states. In Late Breaking Hot Topics Proceedings of IEEE Visualization (Oct. 1998), pp. 45–48.
